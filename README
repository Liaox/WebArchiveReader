This project contains Android WebArchiveReader class - to read web page archive saved with WebView class
saveWebArchive() method. A web archive file is actually an XML file with the contents of the page
encoded in Base64 format, and also contains all sub-frames and objects embedded into a page, such as 
images etc.

WebArchiveReader.java is the actual reader class.
MyActivity.java is a sample activity illustrating how you could use the reader.

Hope this is helpful, enjoy!
